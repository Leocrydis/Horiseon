    In the body where classes "header", "content", and "footer" the tag that contained them was a <div>, thus i changed them to be <section> tags instead

commit: 6ef245bcd77bb605aa7c5ef04b129cbb4f60e3ca

    In the html file under the <section class="benefits"> the <div>'s classes had indiviuals styling in the css stlye sheet when that was not neccessray as they had the same type of styles so i changed the div to -> 
    <div class="benefit-primary> to the divs that where label as benefit-lead, benefit-brand, and benefit-cost.

    this also pertained to the <h3> tag and <img> with in the same section.
